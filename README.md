# About

This is a proof-of-concept of a client side router for Single Page Applications (SPAs).
While working on other React projects, I realized that the de-facto router package that is used
`react-router` is a little complex or their documentation for their version 6 is bad.
I also encountered an issue with their child routes navigation.
Considering this and also wanting to understand client-side routing better, I am creating
this PoC that I plan to use in my personal projects without getting bogged down by the
abstractions of 3rd party apps.

> Note: I have used `react-router-v5` in the past and it was good enough to get the
> job done without any issues. I only faced trouble with v6.

## How to run

```
> npm install
> npm run dev
```
